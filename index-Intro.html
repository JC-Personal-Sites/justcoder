					<h1>About The Video</h1>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<p>The video was created primarily as a bit of fun to collaborate with a friend on creating something new that is rarely seen in the job market.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We had good fun trying out some different concepts and even though things outside of our control stopped the finished article that we wanted i.e. there was originally going to be a section where we used a TikTok effect to jump in and out of the park while I talked about what I like to do in my personal time.  Adding the Star Wars theme to the video I think helps keep it in the light hearted spirit it was created in while adding a nice dimension to it.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Thanks Carly Foster for your time in collaborating on this and helping me.</p>

					<h1>Video Transcript</h1>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<p>Hello my name is Justin Heath and I am looking for work.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I am excited that you have found my video today, over the next 2 minutes I will highlight some of my key assets that I believe can add value to your organisation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>First a little about me, in my personal time I like to……</p>
					<br>	
					<p class="textBold">WAIT what is better than telling you than showing you</p>
					<br>	
					<p class="textBold">** click fingers **</p>
					<br>
					<p class="textRed">In the park</p>
					<br>
					<p>This is where I love to be outside running, walking and exploring.  As a developer I understand the importance of time away from the desk.  These healthy pursuits keep me well and excited to return to work on a Monday morning.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Far to cold on this winters day for just a shirt, lets put that right.</p>
					<br>	
					<p class="textBold">** click fingers **</p>
					<br>
					<p class="textRed">Back in the office.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="textBold">That’s better</p>
					<br>
					<p>For the past 3 years I have been a valued member of a software development team in the NHS leading on numerous projects and engaging with key stakeholders regularly.  I have taken all the projects from design to completion, calling on my years of experience to provide the right solution in a variety of scenarios.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Prior to this I worked as an accountant in the NHS for 15 years.  The numeracy, communication and problem-solving skills acquired in this time provide me with a concrete foundation to progress as a software developer.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="textRed">Rota position at the desk</p>
					<br>
					<p>I am dyslexic, I have never shied away from talking about this as I don’t see a negative. I believe it equips me with a unique set of skills to offer alternative view on a given situation and way to solve it.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Thank you so much for your time today and if you feel my steely determination and can-do attitude could offer value to your organisation this is my website where you can learn more about me and see my portfolio of achievements.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Once again; “thanks you and stay safe.”</p>

					<h1>Professional Statement</h1>
					<hr />
					<br />
					<p>
						Passionate about implementing user-friendly applications with simple functionality but with a big impact on productivity and accuracy all supported by <b>23 years of experience</b>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Over the past six years I have grafted my way from a novice frontend developer to a competent individual now leading a solo project at Bowler Eggs to deliver a <b>MEAN Stack</b> enterprise application to replace five legacy systems and databases.  In my previous life as an accountant, I worked my way up to a <b>'Senior Costing Accountant'</b>.  In this role I was awarded the <b>'NHS HFMA costing award'</b> two years running for my pioneering contribution to costing in the NHS that secured clinical engagement from consultants throughout the hospital.  This led to national adoption, seeing many trusts in the UK looking to replicate the practices I blueprinted in HFMA reports and guidance.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I am very proud I decided to change my career to follow a belief that a role as a developer was the right path for me to take.  I have shown a consistently positive attitude and drive to overcome the challenges of the role whilst crafting my skills.  I have delivered some amazing applications that are making a real difference to the end users and improving processes/data for the organisations.  My proudest achievement in the past six years is <b>teaching five frontend bootcamps with PurpleBeard</b> where I curated the teaching and learning material.  In this time <b>I mentored ten of the students</b> directly which was great to combine my confidence in coding, the engagement I receive while explaining technical problem and all my years in industry to see all ten secure employment as frontend developers.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I am seeking the perfect opportunity that will assist me in achieving my goal of becoming a senior software developer where I can support and guide the next generation of developers.  In return you gain a passionate individual who is keen to grow with the department, years of softs skills harnessed ready to work closely with users to exceed their expectations.  I complement these skills with a constant desire to learn and evolve where I never back down from a challenge and enjoy the opportunity to learn and share.
